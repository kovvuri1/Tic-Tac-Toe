This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using ReactJS. It implements the core game logic using useState to manage the game state, including turn tracking, player switching, and determining the winner. The game starts with Player 1 (cross), followed by Player 2 (circle), and updates the interface dynamically based on player moves. It checks for winning combinations after each move, announcing the winner once a player has successfully aligned three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game's title updates with a congratulatory message upon a win, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.
